The Mac Lab is a creative space on the BYU-Idaho campus, within the David O. McKay Library. We are primarily an Adobe product help lab, but we have four 3D printers, and they available to anyone on campus. 

We love to help teach, and educate on how best to use our Prusa 3D printers. For more information [click here](https://library.byui.edu/maclab/pages/3dprinting.html).
