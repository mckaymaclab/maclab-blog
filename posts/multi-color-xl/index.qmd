The process of loading and unloading filament on the XL multicolor printer is pretty similar to a normal process of changing filament on the other printers.

## 1. Go to Filament

## 2. Select Load Filament

## 3. Choose the Tool Head

Youâ€™ll see this two options where you are going to select the nozzle that you want to put the filament into. In this case, since we only have 2 nozzles (dual extrusion) it only shows 2 tools. For extruder 1 (Tool 1) and extruder 2 (Tool 2).

## 4. Select Material

Once you have selected the tool that you want to load with filament you will see the material options and choose your material (PLA, PETG,etc.)

## 5. Where to Load the Filament

Go to the left part of the printer where you will see the following.

Each straw has a number next to it. Look for the one that has the number of the tool that you chose earlier. Then, insert the filament into the straw until you hear a buzz sound. Then click accept and wait until it the printer purges filament out.

## 6. Repeat the Process for Additional Colors

Repeat steps 2 through 5 for adding an additional color. 

## 7. Starting the Print

When you go to start the actual print the Prusa software helps confirm that you loaded the filament the right by showing a small image of the colored print.

In this case the orange part is my tool 1 and the pink is tool 2.

> Note: These are not the actual colors I loaded, these are reference default colors.

## 8. Unloading Filament

To unload the filament select `Unload Filament` then the tool head number, and unload like you normally would.
